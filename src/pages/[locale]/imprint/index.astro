    <p>
      As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these
      pages according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG under the general laws. However,
      according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted
      or stored external information or to investigate circumstances that
      indicate illegal activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws
      remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from
      the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Liability for Links</h2>
    <p>
      Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose
      contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability
      for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the
      pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The
      linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
      linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
    </p>
    <p>
      A permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable
      without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. Upon becoming aware
      of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
    </p>
